versioning here is related to the version of the test framework, not cheyenne's version number.

v0.6.1 - 22/04/2011
	o Added new tests: HTTP-VERSION, STATUS, 
	
	o Error proofed 'IS-HTTP-DATE? test
	
	o Re-organized tests so they are grouped in separate files, under %test-groups/ 
	
	o cheyenne-http-tests.r, now rebuilt to act as a springboard to launch the various specific test scripts.
	
	o The system now uses vprint logging in order to store the complete unit test trace.
	
	o New functions:  %mezz.r/get-script-version(),  %vprint.r/vlog(), %unit.r/set-default-host()
	
	o Corrected rebol header datestamps in files... was set in the future!
	
	o mezz/parse-url can now cope with file paths and doesn't require host or schema parts of the url.
	  this allows use of the default-port-spec, by only using the part part within the unit test,
	  and using the host info from the default.
	  
	o improved overall unit engine setup so we can easily do tests over and over again, while only giving a new path or url.
      makes HEAD/GET & Host header path testing much easier.
      
    o Added label parameter for unit testing stubs.  This allows reports to store *intent* of each test.
    
    o Completely rebuilt tracing of tests (console and logs), added stats at the end, and failed tests are now extremely obvious.
   
   	o GET currently has 7 tests
   	
   	o HEAD currently has 1 test
   	
   	o HEADERS-Accept-language currently has 3 tests.
   	
   	o Removed files from SVN: 
   		unit-engine-testing.r - Its now pointless, the engine works well enough.
		implementation.txt    - File has been replaced by this changelog.txt file, which is always up to date.


v0.6.0 - 21/04/2011

	o Connection errors are now trapped and added to unit/test-report.

	o Added http-url() and tcp-url() within !unit class.

	o Added Assert() within !unit class.

	o Setup a www site for unit testing.

	o Added SAME-HEADER? test

	o Added RESPONSE-TIME test

	o !unit/Build-http-header now adds the fields to the actual request/header object as well as request/header-buffer

	o added request/user-header.   Accessible via http-test/WITH .
	
	o added automated support for form post data, using new request/params.
